The directory **RQA_detection** contains a matlab executable file **RQA_example.m** and examplary data **NGRIP.csv**. Running the matlab code performs a transition detection on the data based on Recurrence Quantification Analysis. For running the analysis on other data, you should store the data in the same format as the **NGRIP.csv** file and change line 16 in the code to read the corresponding data. Additional settings are defined in lines 19-57.

Further guidance is provided in the file **RQA_example.m** itself.
