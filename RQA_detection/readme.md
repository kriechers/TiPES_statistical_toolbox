# Transition Detection based on Recurrence Quantification Analysis

The directory **RQA_detection** contains a matlab executable file
*RQA_example.m* and examplary data **ngrip_d18o_20y.tex**. Running
the matlab code performs a transition detection on the data based
on Recurrence Quantification Analysis. For using the could on
other data, you should use lines store the data in the same
format as the **ngrip_d18o_20y.tex** and change line 15 in the code
to read the corresponding data.

Further guidance is provided in the file **RQA_example.m** itself.
